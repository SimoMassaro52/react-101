In order to start making actual projects with React, we need to broaden our use of components.
The first thing we will need from now on to start our projects will be a bundler, Vite in this case but there are plenty more.

1. To initialize our ReactVite app we need to have installed npm and node.
Then we run npm create vite@latest   
2. Vite will make us decide the name of our project
3. We select a framework to work with, it will be React in most cases
4. We select in what JS variant our file is in, it being Typescript most of time but for this once we are going to use vanilla JS
5. That's it! The project is ready but it will need some place to run on the web so we are also starting a local server using "npm run dev"

Summary:

1. npm create vite@latest

2. React

3. project folder name

4. Javascript/Typescript variant selection

5. cd project-name

6. npm install

7. npm run dev
