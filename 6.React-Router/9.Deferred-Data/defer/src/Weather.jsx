//We use async functions in JS because we want the code to be aware of the time it takes for a certain part of our script to run before running something else
//When we use the async keyword, we are creating a promise. We are basically promising the code that whatever is doing the asynchronous operation is going to return a result and fulfill (or reject) the promise
//To bring back the benefit of switching components quickly like we did before loaders, we are going to access a React utility called "defer" that doesn't stop the Weather component from rendering even if the data has not been gathered yet

	//We will then return the defer utility, which expects an object whose key will be the name of the deferred data and its value the promise we will resolve
